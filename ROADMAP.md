# groups

An app for randomly generating groups.

## Developement Milestones

1. **Basic algorithm and UI**
   - Can take list of names and a group size and generate groups
   - Generates groups
   - Groups generated later weight based on if people have been together before
   - Uneven groups automatically resolve as smaller groups
   - Displays a group in a clear way for projecting
   - Students can be added or removed
2. **User Accounts**
   - Users can login (through Google)
3. **Can adjust method for handling uneven groups and prevent pairings**
   - When the number of students is not divisible by the number of groups, users can set whether to make same groups 1 bigger or to make some groups 1 smaller
   - Discrete option for preventing pairings (be sure that it is still possible to make groups)
4. **Display history**
   - Show how many times students have been together in 2D array
5. **Easy importing**
   - Make it easy to import student lists from other sources
