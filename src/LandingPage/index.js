        Group Us is a powerful tool to make random groupings. You choose the
        size and how to handle extras, we'll do the rest! The magic of Group Us
        is that it remembers who has been grouped together before and uses that
        memory to adjust future groupings.

        groups are a fantastic way to get people to work with a others.
