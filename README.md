# GroupUs

**Smart, random groupings.**

Group Us generates groups from lists of people (well, really anything). Each time you generate groups, Group Us generates 10,000 random groupings and selects the one where people were previously in the same groups the least.

## Development To Do (mostly in order)

- Get app running on local machine (test with my account and wife's) using save button
- Implement autosave/syncing with useAutoSync which syncs data whenever a function is called
- Make it so you can add sections
- Group sizing should update based on number of kids so you don't get anything funky
- Add modal when arriving if not logged in
- Add Favicon (venn diagram is an idea)
- Add FAQs modal
  - How the groupings work
  - Why visible, random groupings are great
  - Use guide (how to make groups)
- Add feedback link
- Add patreon / Kofi
- Add 2D array of previous pairings
- Add animations
- Add button to show groups in "full screen mode"
- Allow import of students from other platforms
