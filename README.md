# GroupUs

**Smart, random groupings.**

Group Us generates groups from lists of people (well, really anything). Each time you generate groups, Group Us generates 10,000 random groupings and selects the one where people were previously in the same groups the least.

## Development To Do (mostly in order)

- Fix background so it is always full page height and centered info is slightly towards top instead of vertically centered
- Fix issue where deleting a generation changes the generation being displayed.
- Add spinner element
- Group sizing should update based on number of kids so you don't get anything funky
- Add feedback link
- Add patreon / Kofi
- Add 2D array of previous pairings
- Add animations
- Add button to show groups in "full screen mode"
- Allow import of students from other platforms
